[CL:0000442, MeSH:D020566, MP:0008196]
comment: Follicular dendritic cells are a distinct population from other dendritic cells associated with T cells. Follicular dendritic cells have Fc receptors and C3b receptors, but unlike other dendritic cells, they do not process or present antigen in a way that allows recognition by T cells. Instead, they hold antigen in the form of immune complexes on their surfaces for long periods and can present antigen to B cells during an immune response. They are not derived from the hematopoietic lineage. Due to its unique lineage and distinct function (B cell vs. T cell presentation), this is NOT a type of dendritic cell.

comment: Equilibrioception refers to a combination of processes by which an organism can perceive its orientation with respect to gravity. In animals, stimuli come from labyrinth system of the inner ears, monitoring the direction of motion; visual stimuli, with information on orientation and motion; pressure receptors, which tell the organism which body surfaces are in contact with the ground; and proprioceptive cues, which report which parts of the body are in motion.
